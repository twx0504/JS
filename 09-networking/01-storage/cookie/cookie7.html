        // HttpOnly prevents users from accessing cookie via JavaScript
        // - This is for security and safety consideration.
        // - e.g., some data is very sensitive, it should not be read or write by JavaScript.
        // - It is usually set by servers.
        // - HttpOnly cannot be set using JavaScript from the client side.
        // - We can view the effect of HttpOnly from dev tool.
