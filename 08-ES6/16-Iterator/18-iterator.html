      // for - we need to know the data structure and how to access its elements.
      //       For example, with arrays we use length and indices.

      // forEach - follows the iterator design pattern, but it cannot be controlled with
      //           keywords like break, continue, return, or throw.

      // for...in - used to iterate over the enumerable property keys of an object.
      //            It will also include properties from the prototype chain unless filtered out.

      // Example:
      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      Array.prototype.say = function () {};
      arr.abc = 444;

      for (let key in arr) {
        console.log(key);
      }
      // Output:
      // 0
      // 1
      // 2
      // 3
      // abc
      // say   <-- note: properties added to the prototype are also included

      // for...of - allows us to iterate directly over iterable objects (like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.)
      // without worrying about indices or data structure details.
      // Works well with control flow keywords like break, continue, and return.
      // Works for all data structures that implement the iterable protocol (i.e., have [Symbol.iterator]).
